# Face_Recognition_Based_Door_Lock_System-
Door lock security improvement using face detection and recognition has been implemented using Raspberry Pi 3.​
This door lock system consists of 3 phases:​
1. Data Gathering - Collect the face samples that are authorized to open the lock​
2. Training the Recognizer - Train the Recognizer for these face samples​
3. Face Recognition - Trainer data will be used to recognize the faces. When raspberry pi recognizes a face, it will open the door lock.​
